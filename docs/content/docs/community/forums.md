- Dreadbox maintains a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/dreadbox.fx/) with new announcements and some occasional Q&A.
- This [Elektronauts](https://www.elektronauts.com/t/dreadbox-typhon/134235) thread has several owners and has been a good place to track the first few months of people experiences. A lot of info on this site was lifted from this thread.
