This Elektronauts thread has several owners and has been a good place to track the first few months of people experiences. A lot of info on this site was lifted from this thread.</description></item><item><title>Tutorial Videos</title><link>https://dreadboxunofficial.github.io/TyphonWiki/docs/community/videos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dreadboxunofficial.github.io/TyphonWiki/docs/community/videos/</guid><description>Tutorial Videos # Loopop has posted a very good walkthrough of the Typhon explaining how the oscillator &amp;amp; filter adjustments work, how to use the modulators and FX, as well as some example patch ideas. The step mod section is especially helpful and includes a chart going from the 0-100 range to semitones. This video used the v1.1 firmware, so some of the newer FX are not covered.</description></item></channel></rss>
