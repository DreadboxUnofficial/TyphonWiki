# Tutorial Videos

-  [Loopop](https://loopopmusic.com/) has posted a very good walkthrough of the Typhon explaining how the oscillator & filter adjustments work, how to use the modulators and FX, as well as some example patch ideas. The step mod section is especially helpful and includes a chart going from the 0-100 range to semitones. This video used the v1.1 firmware, so some of the newer FX are not covered.
