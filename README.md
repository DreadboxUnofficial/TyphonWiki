# TyphonWiki
User-maintained documentation, tips &amp; tricks for the Dreadbox Typhon synthesizer

This is @patricklang, and I'm trying to collect docs, tips and tricks for the new Dreadbox Typhon synth into an easy to use site. Currently I'm trying to get Hugo or some other publishing engine up that can publish to GitHub pages automatically. I want it to be easy to add notes and update docs as everyone tries things out so you don't have to read hundreds of forum posts to find what you need.

Once I have the publishing working, I'll add links to the formatted docs and info on how you can add new stuff.

Cheers,
Patrick





## Work in Progress - Using Hugo

Get Hugo - be sure to use the extended version from https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases.

```
cd docs
hugo server --minify --theme book
```

Browse to the URL in the Hugo output - probably http://localhost:1313/
